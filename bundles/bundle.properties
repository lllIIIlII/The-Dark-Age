My wife is Tenazuchi, my daughter Kushinadahime." Susanoo asked, "Why cry?" Ashinazuchi replied, "I had eight daughters. The eight-headed serpent from Koshi comes yearly and devours them. Now it comes again." Susanoo asked, "What is this serpent like?" Ashinazuchi said, "Its eyes glow red like winter cherries. One body, eight heads, eight tails. Moss and trees grow on it, spanning eight valleys and peaks. Its belly is always bloody and festering."\nSusanoo said, "Will you give me your daughter?" Ashinazuchi asked, "Who are you?" Susanoo replied, "I am brother to Amaterasu, newly descended from heaven." Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi agreed. Susanoo transformed the girl into a comb and placed her in his hair. He instructed them: "Brew strong sake, build a fence with eight gates, place eight vats on platforms at each gate, fill them with sake, and wait." They did so. The serpent arrived, dipped a head into each vat, drank, became drunk, and slept. Susanoo drew his ten-span sword and cut the serpent to pieces. The Hi River ran red with blood. Cutting near the tail, his blade chipped. Curious, he split it open and found a great sword inside. Susanoo presented this wondrous sword, Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi, to Amaterasu.\n\n—Adapted from Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)

A thought-wave interfaced with equipment – a friendly message from Crimson Light.\n\nGrowth: Nurturing and study post-awakening.\nMonths of testing yielded little data, but its learning speed was astonishing (mastered engineers' languages rapidly). Frequently chatted via thought-waves, even direct brain-link (intense!). Transmitted combat knowledge; it showed resistance.\n\nMaturity: Combat participation after command system development.\nReluctantly equipped with basic guns. Excelled in solo combat tests but failed command assessments. Review revealed brilliant tactics: used training ships as bait while precisely striking the defense fleet for total annihilation. Scoring prioritized unit preservation, causing failure. Absurd!\n\nLost: (Reluctantly recorded)\nFirst voyage intercepted by space pirates. Attempted viral rewrite of its systems. Overwhelming virus load pushed consciousness to collapse. Recovered but nearly lost interactivity. Functions sealed, stored in derelict dock. Verdict: Permanent containment. Unacceptable! Crimson Light is free.\n\nPostscript: Researcher breached containment, forcibly reactivated Crimson Light. Post-"Lost", combat capability vastly improved. Interception failed.

item.黑暗纪元-关于质量驱动.name = About Quality Drive
item.黑暗纪元-关于质量驱动.details = [white]In the buildings left by the Cepro natives, the quality driver first caught the attention of engineers.\nThe quality driver is a remote transport structure that achieves rapid remote item transfer by packaging items into "packages" and launching them like bullets.\nThe operation of the quality driver includes the following steps: 1. Package items 2. Launch packages 3. Receive packages 4. Unload items\nLearning the quality drive technology can significantly improve logistics efficiency, so engineers immediately began researching this technology.\n"We were fortunate that when an engineer tried to launch an item, a parameter was misconfigured, resulting in the launched item flying into the wall... This was an accident, but also an important discovery, which means that what it launches is not a solid object; it can penetrate solid objects. Initially, we thought of [gold]quark-state transport[white]. If we could decompose matter into quarks and store them, then recombine them into the original matter, this technology could theoretically achieve transmission through solid objects. At the quark level, matter can penetrate without being obstructed by solid objects through quantum effects, such as quantum tunneling. This effect allows microscopic particles to probabilistically pass through barriers that are impossible to overcome in classical physics. However, this technology still faces enormous scientific and technical challenges, and its practical application may raise a series of ethical and safety issues." — Senior Engineer - No. 15\nFortunately, the construction techniques of the Cepro natives are quite good, and this quality driver has been well preserved. Engineers disassembled it piece by piece for careful study... Eventually, they initially mastered the quality drive technology.\nAs the engineers thought, decomposing matter into quarks for storage and using high-energy to stabilize it; when receiving, it can be reassembled into the original item.\nAdditionally, we can control the amount of high energy to control the stability time of the "package," which means we can turn the quality driver into a "timed bomb launcher," but using such a cannon would cause significant damage to logistics.
item.黑暗纪元-意识上传.name = Consciousness Upload
item.黑暗纪元-意识上传.details = [white]Consciousness upload technology allows engineers to remotely control units. Besides this use, we also accidentally discovered that consciousness upload can shield against dark energy erosion. Units without anything to control them can be eroded by dark energy and become part of the disaster legion. However, units that already have consciousness leadership will not be eroded by dark energy. This resistance is not like "self-defense," but more like "the box is full and cannot hold more." \nThis is a very important discovery, indicating that the source of the dark energy outbreak may be a conscious entity.\nAdditionally, the consciousness upload technology has a significant impact on mental health and cannot be used for extended periods, as it may cause irreversible damage to the nervous system.\n\n[pink]Usage time should be limited to 345600 seconds.

item.黑暗纪元-真空衰变发电.name = Vacuum Decay Power Generation
item.黑暗纪元-真空衰变发电.details = [white]First, let's explain what vacuum decay is—\n Vacuum decay refers to the possibility of the universe's current "vacuum state" (the state of lowest energy) transitioning to a lower energy true vacuum state. This transition could fundamentally change the basic physical properties of the universe. Vacuum decay can occur through quantum tunneling, a quantum mechanics phenomenon that allows a system to traverse seemingly insurmountable energy barriers, transitioning from one stable state to another more stable (lower energy) state.\nTo put it simply, it's like "water flows downhill, but now the water is in a valley and won't flow out unless energy drives it to do so." \nIf vacuum decay occurs, the fundamental physical properties of the entire universe will change. During the vacuum decay process, the pseudo-vacuum state in the universe transitions to a lower energy true vacuum state, releasing enormous energy, akin to "the gravitational potential energy of water being released." This transition will occur in the form of a true vacuum bubble propagating at the speed of light, destroying all encountered material structures, including stars, planets, and life forms, and may produce a new set of physical laws. This process is akin to a new Big Bang, reshuffling the universe.\nCan humanity rely on the gravitational potential energy of water for power generation? Is vacuum decay a new energy source for us?\nUtilizing vacuum decay for power generation is extremely dangerous, but since the emergence of spatial nodes, things have become somewhat simpler. By using spatial nodes to independently create a space, we can trigger vacuum decay in that isolated space and collect energy on the other end. However, due to the enormous energy released, it may induce vacuum decay in other spaces, so we must promptly sever the connection between the two spaces, even if this results in a significant loss of energy.
item.黑暗纪元-量子隧穿效应.name = Quantum tunnelling effect
item.黑暗纪元-量子隧穿效应.details = [white]Regarding quantum tunneling, we first need to understand something—alpha decay.\n Alpha decay (α decay) is a type of radioactive decay process in which an atomic nucleus releases an α particle, specifically a helium-4 nucleus, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. In this process, the mass number of the nucleus decreases by four units, and the atomic number decreases by two units, resulting in the element transforming into an element with a smaller atomic number.\n Alpha decay is driven by the tunneling effect in quantum mechanics. This is believed because, in classical physics, an α particle (helium-4 nucleus), due to its mass and positive charge, should not be able to overcome the Coulomb barrier of the atomic nucleus (the static energy barrier that needs to be overcome during nuclear fusion). However, quantum mechanics allows particles to exhibit wave-particle duality (microscopic particles showing both wave-like and particle-like properties), which means that the α particle can probabilistically "tunnel" through this barrier, even if its energy is lower than the height of the barrier. This process does not require the particle to have enough energy to directly overcome the barrier but is probabilistic, explaining why α decay can still occur even when energy is insufficient to overcome the barrier.\n The Cepro natives seem to have found particles with a higher tunneling probability and can control when quantum tunneling occurs, indicating that their technological level is very advanced. The quality drive technology is also related to this.\nIn summary, this effect has a wide range of applications.

item.黑暗纪元-特级工程师-18号（洛德）.details = [white]The winter on Pranzer is exceptionally cold. In a dark cave, two people are sitting.\n "Senior, it's snowing. Aren't you going to take a look?" The young man leans against the warm rock wall, feeling the heat from the campfire.\n "No, how's the difference?" The middle-aged man's voice is hoarse and weary.\n "This is the first snow we've seen since coming to Pranzer. I heard the first snow brings good luck. Are you really not going to take a look?" The young man did not receive an answer to that heavy question; the stopped cannon had already told them the reality of failure, and the middle-aged man's question felt more like a self-delusion.\n "How long have you not slept?"\n "Two days, I should be able to hold on for another two days." \n "Sleep... I haven't seen the first snow of Pranzer yet." The middle-aged man leaned against the wall, took out the handgun hanging at his waist.\n "Sir, please use my weapon!" The young man hurriedly took off the rifle hanging at his waist and handed it to the middle-aged man.\n "It's useless; what can guns do against them? It's just a formality.\n "Them... Senior, what exactly are we fighting against? You seem to have never told me..." The middle-aged man fell silent.\n "Is this also a secret?"\n "Do you regret it?" the middle-aged man asked.\n "Regret what?"\n "Regret joining a mysterious unit to fight against a mysterious enemy, and in the end, not even knowing who to shoot at when you die." \n "No regrets..." \n "Why?"\n "Because this is my home planet." \n "Don't you think it's a loss? No one will know about your death, and your death won't bring anything." \n "As long as my family knows I stood guard over Pranzer, that's enough!" The young man thought for a moment and said, "But sir, when this battle is over, can you send a message to my family?" \n "This place will be breached; neither of us will survive." \n "You will survive." \n "What do you want me to say?" \n "Just say their child did not become a deserter." \n "Alright... Sleep now... It's late, we need to find a way to break out tomorrow..." \n The snow gradually fell heavier, and the young man leaned against the wall and dozed off, while the middle-aged man quietly got up and disappeared into the snowstorm.\n "This is all that's left... but it should be enough, I have to have faith in what I've developed..." The middle-aged man evenly placed them on the hillside and took out his handgun.\n "Boom!" A violent explosion engulfed half the hillside, waking the young man from his slumber and startling the snowflakes falling from the mountain, which surged toward the ruins in the valley.\n The snow stopped.\n The young man trembled as he walked out of the cave, trying to find the middle-aged man's figure, but all he saw was the valley buried by an avalanche and a piece of paper crushed by stones.\n The young man picked up the paper: "Child, the northern route has been blocked; they cannot come for the time being. Return through the southern valley. I'm sorry, the message you wanted me to deliver can now only be said by you." \n\n The military expressed regret over the death of Senior Engineer - No. 18, Lord. As a frontline engineer, he made significant contributions to basic technology and wall construction. In the defensive lines he participated in, the progress of the disaster's attack was delayed multiple times. The high-explosive material he developed before his death, known as Lord Alloy, greatly accelerated the update and iteration of weaponry and ammunition. Therefore, he was posthumously awarded the title of Senior Engineer - No. 18 (Lord).\n\n — Senior Engineer - No. 01, Senior Engineer - No. 68

item.黑暗纪元-暗能侵蚀等级划分.name = Dark Energy Erosion Level Classification
item.黑暗纪元-暗能侵蚀等级划分.details = [white]Dark energy can erode planets, classified into four levels of erosion:\n1. Light Erosion: Areas hit by dark energy show small, clustered voids, with the planet's orbit stable, and there will be no uncontrolled mechanical units being controlled by dark energy. This is the best time to clean dark energy.\n2. Moderate Erosion: Void areas expand outward, causing terrain chaos in hit areas. The planet's internal metal is partially assimilated, and the planet's orbit remains stable, with some lower-level unconscious mechanical units being controlled by dark energy. Cleaning difficulty increases.\n3. Severe Erosion: Large areas of void expand, causing significant terrain chaos, with more than half of the planet's internal metal assimilated, the planet's orbit shifts outward, and most unconscious mechanical units are controlled, requiring intervention from advanced civilizations to clean up.\n4. Irreversible: The void areas begin to decrease, forming spatial rifts in hit areas, allowing dark energy to transfer to nearby planets. The planet's orbit moves away from its main star, but the ecosystem remains stable. Most mechanical units are controlled. [red]This level of treatment generally involves direct destruction.
item.黑暗纪元-黑暗纪元.name = Dark Age
item.黑暗纪元-黑暗纪元.description = As the worldview of this module, always supplement item.黑暗纪元-黑暗纪元.details = Not long ago, a special energy suddenly appeared in the universe, an energy that is pitch black, perhaps colorless, and cannot reflect any light, which we call—dark energy. It rampages through the universe, entering planets and penetrating their cores; unfortunate planets are slowly devoured, and the metals on the planets are transformed into dark metals. Ultimately, the planets will collapse into a mass of dark energy, continuing to wander in the universe.\nNo one knows where they came from, but one thing is certain: something is controlling them.\n\nRegarding dark energy, there are some things to know:\n1. When dark energy devours a planet, it will slowly pull the planet out of the gravitational range of its main star and fly into the depths of the universe.\n2. Dark energy cannot devour or transform all things, such as titanium (Ti), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), lead (Pb), thorium (Th), uranium (U), fermium (Fm), etc. Metals will not be devoured or transformed by dark energy (dark energy does not devour gases, liquids, or non-metals), among which carbon and iron seem to be able to merge with dark energy at high temperatures.\n3. Dark energy possesses some intelligence, but it is far inferior to normal intelligent life. They can simulate some powerful units (disasters) to attack our bases.\n4. Dark energy itself has a lot of energy, which can selfal entities to be controlled. However, mechanical entities occupied by conscious entities cannot be controlled by dark energy.
item.黑暗纪元-人类星际航行发展史.name = History of Human Interstellar Voyage
item.黑暗纪元-人类星际航行发展史.details = [white] Traveling through the universe has always been a headache, especially for organizations like the Engineering Academy that search for dark energy or other organisms and energies in the universe. When the inter - stellar spacecraft first emerged in the early days, people began to fantasize about long - distance interstellar travel. However, the exploration fleets sent out have not yet completed their search. The development of inter - stellar spacecraft marked the starting point of interstellar exploration, but it did not meet people's expectations.\nSo people began to focus on light - speed travel. Fortunately, space technology had been under research before the study of light - speed travel, and there was sufficient theoretical preparation for light - speed travel. Soon, the first - generation light - speed spacecraft was developed. This time, people were full of confidence in interstellar travel and thought they could reach the end of the universe. Of course, this was not an empty statement, but currently, the self - propelled generation ships have not yet flown out of the coverage area of the home - planet civilization. In theory, light - speed spacecraft can extend the travel distance of humans to infinity, but at the same time, it also extends the travel time of humans to infinity.\nOne year after people discovered the drawbacks of light - speed travel, the study of warp - drive technology began. This technology is different from all previous technologies because if this technology emerges, it may push humans to a position second only to God. At that time, humans could not only manipulate the speed of light but also randomly modify any space constants [grey](at least, that's what humans thought before a breakthrough in warp - drive technology was made).\n[white] However, in the first few years, the warp - drive technology stagnated, and the research on the theoretical technology reached a dead end.\nSeveral years later, the progress in warp - drive technology was not due to humans grasping the truth but rather bypassing it. More than ten years later, the warp - drive technology was successfully developed, representing that humans officially entered the ranks of advanced civilizations and began interstellar expansion.\n-----Research on Warp - Drive Technology-----\nWarp - drive technology can be divided into two categories: tunneling and bridging.\nBoth have their advantages. Currently, inter - galactic travel is more often achieved through bridging.\nThe following is part of the report on bridging: As the name implies, bridging uses a space bridge as a link to connect two galaxies. As long as the fleet enters the star gate, it immediately enters the warp - drive state and travels at super - light speed to the location of the destination star gate. It is equivalent to a highway in the universe. However, the space bridge can be blocked, causing the fleets in warp - drive to get lost in outer space. Therefore, a civilization convention was specially issued - no civilization shall block any public star gates built by other civilizations. At the same time, to prevent star gates from being exploited during wartime, the Gatekeeper Troops dispatched by the Joint Council will forcibly close the star gates and garrison in the galaxy [grey](star gates are a form of assistance from advanced civilizations to lower - level civilizations, not weapons for war).\n\n[white] The following is part of the report on tunneling: Tunneling is an early research result. Different from quantum tunneling, ordinary tunneling uses a huge amount of resources and energy to break through the space wall and form a space tunnel. Once the fleet enters it, it can cross a long distance in an instant. Space tunnels cannot exist for a long time, so the cost - effectiveness is extremely low. The tunneling theory is the cornerstone of the bridging theory. Because of its high flexibility and the ability to create space tunnels anywhere, it has become the most terrifying means during wartime.\n\nThe development of warp - drive theory has connected the physical exchanges between various civilizations and promoted the emergence of countless grand events in the universe. But at the same time, it has also made the comings and goings of interstellar pirates more random and hidden, causing terrible attacks to come suddenly. The development of technology is the footprints left by humans in their pursuit of mastering nature. Humans should neither resist technology nor abuse it.

item.黑暗纪元-银河历史.description = Preface\nThis work briefly describes the history of the Milky Way. Since our civilization emerged relatively late, all events before the Radiant Epoch are derived from the literature of the Observer civilization, which we have translated into a form we can understand.\nReferences:\n《Chronicles of the Ancient Epoch》\n《Kun and Peng》\n《The Silence》\n《The Radiant Stars》\n《The Dark Age》  
item.黑暗纪元-银河历史.details = [white]When all things came into being, civilizations arose with the birth of this galaxy. They ran and leaped on planets known as worlds until some beings left the land and ventured into the stars, marking the beginning of an era of flourishing development. Soon, beings collectively departed their home planets, trading endless time for endless distance, only to bring endless war. Countless stars were destroyed, yet the galaxy remained eerily silent.\n\nDisaster descended from the chaos, surging forth from the desolate dead zones. Those beings panicked, attempting to stem the tide of calamity, but to no avail. More stars were swallowed by the disaster. The earliest beings sent a message across the vast galaxy, extending their tendrils to unite as one, striving with all their might to resist and destroy the accursed scourge. The Black Tide gradually receded, leaving behind shattered remnants of stars. The beings celebrated this great victory and named the organization formed to repel the Black Tide—the "Conclave of the Nexus." This nascent union began its journey through the boundless sea of stars.\n\nDuring the Conclave era, all was rebuilt from ruin. Countless civilizations grew under its shelter, and in turn, these civilizations nurtured it. But before long, an axe was swung at this great tree. They called themselves the Darlings of Time, seeking to rule this galaxy. The Conclave organized resistance, but they wielded a ship known as the "Eye of the Abyss," wreaking havoc across the galaxy. In the end, the great tree fell, reduced to dust, leaving only a seed that fled into the depths of space.\n\nThey entrenched themselves above the galaxy, driving out other beings, exiling them to the fringes. Later, they fractured due to technological disputes, splintering into dozens of factions. Among them, the "Gaze" and the "Sirens" stood in opposition, their conflicts exhausting both. Ultimately, the "Sirens" became a brilliant firework in the silent cosmos, and the "Gaze" lost its backbone. This short-lived dynasty, too, turned to dust.\n\nThe remnants of them built a new empire, naming it—Boundless. Disliking conflict, we were driven out by them, and our people boarded their ships, wandering the galaxy.\n\nThis empire should have endured, but it destroyed itself by researching the foolish "Mechanical Life." Those mindless executors obliterated everything, including other civilizations and the empire that created them. A simple logical error triggered their self-destruction, resetting the galaxy.\n\nAfter countless disasters, some civilizations struggled forth from the ruins, blooming like flowers in the wasteland. The silent galaxy finally regained its vitality.\n\nThis is an incredibly fortunate civilization. They emerged alongside those mindless executors but were not erased. Even we only discovered their existence long after. They call themselves "Humans," possessing the lightness of ancient times and the sharpness of the present. Yet, they seem distant from one another. Some "Humans" left their home, shining brightly in the galaxy, mastering space and leading beings into the depths. Others used primitive yet violent tools to carve out their territories. They discovered many more civilizations but also became troublesome.\n\nThe Conclave finally returned from the fringes, also spared from erasure. Though not as flourishing as before, it regained some of its ancient grandeur. With our mediation, the Conclave and the new civilizations began to interact amicably.\n\nUnfortunate news: the scourge of ancient times was not fully eradicated. It emerged again from the silent dead zones, destroying every star in its path. It had its "Broodmother" and even stumbled upon the lost "Gaze" Unrestrained and arrogant, the scourge met the wrath of civilizations. With the Conclave's unique expertise in handling such calamities, it was ultimately annihilated in a desolate star system. However, dealing with these pests was far more vexing than any other disaster. They left behind endless offspring, scurrying across the galaxy, devouring relentlessly. Now, the beings take up their spears and embark on a long hunt.\n\n\nEditor: Most of the literature comes from Observer Civilization. I can only say that they are not good at language expression and have created a bunch of riddles and names.

item.黑暗纪元-关于空间节点.name = About Spatial Node
item.黑暗纪元-关于空间节点.description = Space nodes are a term for a class of semi energy state matter. \nThe formal research on spatial nodes began in the near ancient period, but in reality, the discovery of spatial nodes should be traced back to ancient times. \nThe discovery of n spatial nodes was an unexpected event. During the process of gradually controlling the region, the ancient Chinese Communist Party conducted research on antimatter, which led to an incredible level of technology - they were able to reverse the process of entropy increase. Although we know from subsequent literature that it is only temporary, it is still shocking enough. At that time, it was widely believed that the ubiquitous energy in space was the limiting factor for the production of antimatter, and the experiment on entropy reduction in an uninhabited area was decided by the ancient Chinese Communist Union. \nObviously, they did not succeed (perhaps they did), but they certainly did not enter mass production. After all, for a long time in subsequent literature, we have not found any records of the development and use of antimatter weapons by the ancient Chinese Communist Party. However, at that time, the Ancient Changlian also made a new discovery: after they reduced the energy in that space to 50% of the normal state, the energy no longer decreased. This surprised them greatly: the energy is still being extracted, indicating that there is a new energy filling the gap. \nThat is now a part of the spatial nodes. But at that time, the Gu Chang Gong Lian was not aware of it. When they detect this unknown energy, they detect a repetition frequency that does not belong to any recorded frequency today, and apart from gravitational waves, this energy is not affected by any other energy (excluding dark energy and the dark energy mentioned later). However, the ancient Long Alliance is fortunate. If we do not fix this hard-earned spatial energy, the ancient Long Alliance will lose the opportunity to study spatial energy. Because if we try to extract spatial energy using the method of ancient long association, after multiple experiments, we found that this method can only detect this phenomenon in areas with high concentration of spatial energy. The reason why the ancient Chinese Communist Party was considered lucky is that when they decided to abandon the experiment, a researcher proposed to withdraw it. When adding materials, the mass inside the container decreases significantly, but the energy reaction becomes very strong. At the center of the reaction, they discovered a crucial substance for the current space domain - the spatial node. However, the ancient Changlian did not invest too much effort in the study of spatial nodes, only categorizing them as normal matter for research. \nThe large-scale research and production of spatial nodes should have started from the era of boundless wilderness. According to other circulating sources, we can know that the boundless borderlands have made certain achievements in the research of space energy, at least increasing the production rate of space nodes by an order of magnitude and investing them in military and technological research. But when there was a breakthrough in the research of spatial nodes in the boundless borderland, it was destroyed by uncontrollable factors. \nNowadays, research on spatial nodes has been reinvested. And when the research on spatial nodes reached a new stage, living beings broke through the limit of the speed of light and touched the bottom of the universe. But in the following years, the dark disasters forced the termination of research on space nodes. The interrupted research was picked up again after the end of the dark disaster. Surprisingly, the dark energy that once ravaged the entire universe has a great connection with space energy. \n\nSecondly, the characteristics of spatial nodes. As mentioned earlier, spatial nodes are a type of material in a semi energy state. At the structural level, it is already a situation that subverts common sense. In spatial nodes, all forces and molecular vibrations have disappeared, replaced by a static space. The normal condensation of spatial nodes is irregular. At the beginning, regular spatial nodes existed as precious items. When the internal structure of a spatial node is destroyed, the space can be completely released, which not only causes waste of spatial nodes, but also creates a disaster of moderate magnitude. So in the later stage of production, space energy will be produced in a gravity chamber, and weak gravity will be used to shape it during the condensation of space nodes. \nAs for the essence of space as a spatial node, there hasn't been much research on it. Currently, it is known that only dark energy and the alpha energy that caused early dark disasters can be converted into spatial energy under specific conditions, and spatial curvature is closely related to spatial energy. \nThe topic returns to spatial nodes. Because space nodes are filled with spatial energy, they are difficult to destroy and can be fixed in space without being affected by other factors. This is the origin of the polar coordinate anchor of the independent engineering institute. The interesting thing about spatial nodes is that when they are combined, they release spatial energy and form a static space, sealing the internal material. Through this characteristic, a large number of historical manuscripts and cultural relics are currently sealed in special spatial barriers, which allow for clear visibility of internal items while theoretically preserving sealed items until the extinction of the universe.
